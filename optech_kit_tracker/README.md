## Reflection

**Liked**
- Liked the challenge overall, wide array of different tasks that needed to be completed to achieve the overall result.
- The way I split the program down into different parts as to not bloat the main file itself.
- How it is all pieced together to create the actual program.

**Disliked**
- The headaches.
- Overall mistakes that were made throughout.

**Future Proof**
- Scale to be ported to applications, to be able to run on phones. Allowing it to be utilised whilst mobile.
- Tidy up the GUI and add a bit of beauty, currently looks very military as in gets the job done but that's it.
- Add more features, spcifially isolating API updates specific to when an event occurs not just overall.
